## ðŸŽ§ About it

The sole purpose of this application is streaming episodes of a single podcast feed. In this case, the chosen podcast was _"Fala Dev"_, created by the RocketSeat team. The episodes are provided by a server generated via JSON Server, using an JSON object which contains all episodes data.

As an educational program, _NLW_ has the purpose of teaching techniques and skills, in different programming languages and areas ( in this case, front-end development using React and Next.js). So, developing this application was a way to learn about **Server Site Rendering**, **Static Site Generation**, **Contexts** and many other concepts linked to modern web development.

As a personal touch, I've used _Styled Components_ for managing styles. The objective was to learn more about the tool, and preparing the environment of the application to future enhancements, such as responsive design and personalizing themes.
